			<h1> Lab 7: Intro to CSS </h1>
			<h2> Challenge: </h2>
			<p> This Lab was quite easy for me and especially fun. I enjoy
			using CSS.</p>
			<h2> Problems: </h2>
			<p> One small problem I had was trying to figure out how to add the
			linear gradient background but I figured it out!</p>
			<h2> Results: </h2>
			<p> My website before the CSS looked boring and plain but now after
			adding the CSS code, it brought the website some life and it looks
			alot better.</p>
