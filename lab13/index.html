			<h1> Lab 13: Typography I </h1>
			<h2> Challenge: </h2>
			<p> As expected, this lab was for sure one of the more difficult labs
			and time consuming. It was fun although completing this lab even with
			how challenging it was.</p>
			<h2> Problems: </h2>
			<p>	One of the main problems that I ran across was trying to figure out
			how to position the text the specific way I wanted but I was able to
			figure it out. Another problem that I was having for some reason was
			simply trying to insert my background image, I eventually figured it
			out.</p>
			<h2> Results: </h2>
			<p> I think my fake website looks somewhat similar to the original and
			I look forward to the next lab.
