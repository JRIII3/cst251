	<h1> Lab 4: File Transfer </h1>
	<h2> Difficulties/Results </h2>
	<p> One common difficulty I encountered that I look forward to stop coming
			across is the small simple errors I make when coding. I spent a little too
			much time debugging for my liking but I am glad I am realizing my mistakes
			so I can prevent them in the future. I am happy with my results so far
 			look forward to improving. </p>
