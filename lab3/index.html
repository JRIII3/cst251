	<h1> Lab 3 File Structures </h1>
	<p> The main idea of this lab is to understand how to create a local
		file structure on the computer. </p>
	<h2> Challenges/ Difficulties </h2>
	<p> One of the main difficulties that I have had so far that I am still
		working on is linking my image to my homepage and Lab 3 website
		and I am excited to keep working on future websites.</p>
