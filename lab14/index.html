			<h1> Lab 14: Typography II </h1>
			<h2> Challenge: </h2>
			<p> This lab was just as challenging as Lab 13, even though I know I
			didn't choose the hardest article, it was still fun to try and remake.</p>
			<h2> Problems: </h2>
			<p>	My main problem was trying to find the right fonts that looked as
			similar as possible to the original article and positioning the image
			and text in the desired place.</p>
			<h2> Results: </h2>
			<p> My fake website now looks quite similar to the original and I look
			forward to future labs.</p>
