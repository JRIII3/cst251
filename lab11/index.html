				<h1> Lab 11: Advanced Block-level Styling I </h1>
				<h2> Challenge: </h2>
				<p> This lab was different and fun. It was quite challenging abit
				which was fun for me.</p>
				<h2> Problems: </h2>
				<p>	The main problem I had was trying to figure out how to get the
				sticky function to work for my sidebar.</p>
				<h2> Results: </h2>
				<p> My website now looks much better after styling with CSS.</p>
				<aside id="sidebar">
					<h2> Random facts about me: </h2>
					<p> Some interesting facts about me are that I have an older half sister
						that shares the same birthday as me. One of my biggest fears that I am
						willing to admit are bubbles. This is because when I was little, a
						bubble popped in my eye and ever since, I have always tried to avoid
						them whenever there happens to be some wherever I am at. </p>
					<p> Another fear that I have are specifically spiders. Even tho almost
						all spiders are harmless, I just don't like to be around them so I
						don't mess with those. </p>
