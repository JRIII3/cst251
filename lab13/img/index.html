			<h1> Lab 12: Advanced Block-level Styling II </h1>
			<h2> Challenge: </h2>
			<p> This lab was quite easy for me with a few small challenges along
			with it.</p>
			<h2> Problems: </h2>
			<p>	I didn't really run into many problems in this lab apart from
			trying to figure how to center the image both horizontally and
			vertically but I was able to figure it out.</p>
			<h2> Results: </h2>
			<p> My website turned out well and have succesfully completed the
			tasks.</p>
