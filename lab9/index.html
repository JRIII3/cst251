			<h1> Lab 9: Styling Block Elements </h1>
			<h2> Challenge: </h2>
			<p> A small challenge I had was trying to add the linear gradient
			background color in my website but I was able to figure it out</p>
			<h2> Problems: </h2>
			<p>	This lab was quite similar to the lab before so I didn't really
			run into any major problems except some small mistakes that I easily
			was able to fix.</p>
			<h2> Results: </h2>
			<p>	Just like the last lab, my website looked much better and
			eye-appealing after styling with CSS</p>
			<h2> Image of a pug : </h2>
			<img src="img/pug.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="250" width="500"/>
