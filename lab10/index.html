			<h1> Lab 10: Styling Text Elements </h1>
			<h2> Challenge: </h2>
			<p> This lab was fun for me and was similar to Lab 8 and 9.</p>
			<h2> Problems: </h2>
			<p>	Just like the last labs, this was lab was easy for me and I
			didn't run into any problems or have a tough time with anything.</p>
			<h2> Results: </h2>
			<p> After styling with CSS and using the font styles, my website
		 	looked much better rather than a website with plain white and black.</p>
