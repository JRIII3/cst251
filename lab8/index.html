			<h1> Lab 8: CSS Selectors </h1>
			<h2> Challenge: </h2>
			<p> For this lab, I felt the same as the last lab. At first I had to
					figure out and get used to how to style an element within
					another element.</p>
			<h2> Problems: </h2>
			<p>	I didn't really run into many problems in this lab but some simple
					mistakes but I was able to figure them out.</p>
			<h2> Results: </h2>
			<p>	Before styling with CSS, my website is plain white and boring
					but after styling, in result, it brought my website some life.</p>
